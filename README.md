The reason for creating this project is to demonstrate our skills in implementing the Lightning Network and utilizing various technologies to establish a remittance service that is easy to understand and offers a competitive fee structure, allowing us to enter the market of money transfer services to different parts of the world.

The interface was designed in such a way that anyone, regardless of their technological knowledge, can navigate through our website. We also provide the convenience for users to deposit fiat money in order to effectively send remittances to their families or friends with minimal interest charges.

Another important aspect is that we, as a group, ensure that the recipient of the remittance can withdraw their funds using any wallet that accepts Lightning Network transfers. We take the responsibility of securely transferring the funds from point A to point B.

Furthermore, it's worth mentioning that we utilize ZBD technology to manage our Lightning Network channels, which reduces concerns about liquidity and the nodes connected to ours.

As a group, we have been considering the development of various technologies in the future, allowing users to contribute to our project. That's why we have shared our GitHub repository, where others can contribute in areas such as implementing transaction alerts, sending receipts to different email addresses, and creating mobile applications for different operating systems.

In conclusion, we send our blessings and greetings on behalf of The Lightning Walkers group.
